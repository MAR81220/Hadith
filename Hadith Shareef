On the authority of Hazrat Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, the Messenger of Allah, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: The example of the Prophets before me and me, may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them, is that a palace was built very well and a brick was left empty in it. People used to walk around her and marveled at her good construction, but she would notice a single brick in their eyes. I am the last brick of prophethood, I am the seal of all prophets. (Sahih al-Bukhari)
